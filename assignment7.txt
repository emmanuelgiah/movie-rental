Implementing the following two new policies for a coupon system: 
- The customer class has coupon parameters
- There are two possible type of coupons
- We modify the compute rental prices strategy based off the parameters


a.	A coupon for a rental that allows 50% off the entire rental price. 
- Divide the price in half

b.	A coupon for a rental that takes 10$ off for a total rental of more than 50$. 
- Subtract ten from the price
